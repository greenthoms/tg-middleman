            <p>As the sole UX designer at Synergetic Management Systems, I was tasked with the challenge of redesigning a legacy interface and implementing a new design direction for the industry leading school management software.</p>
            <p>Working alongside stakeholders, business analysts I designed new product features including a dashboard for teachers, an online enrollment hub for internation students and a mobile first booking interface for carer teacher interviews.</p>
            <p>I initiated usability test sessions with teachers and administration staff both remotely and onsite. I also created a living style guide and collaborated with full-stack developers on design implementation and front-end development.</p>
